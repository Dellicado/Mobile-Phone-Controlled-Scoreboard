# Mobile-Phone-Controlled-Scoreboard
A Project using MIT App Inventor
ðŸ“± Mobile Phone Controlled Scoreboard
A flexible, portable scoreboard system designed for real-time control via mobile devices. This project combines hardware simplicity with customizable software to create a dynamic display solution for sports events, competitions, and community activities.

ðŸ”§ Hardware Overview
4x P10 LED Display Panels â€“ Seamlessly tiled to form a large, readable scoreboard.

Bluetooth Module (HC-05) â€“ Enables wireless communication between the mobile app and the microcontroller.

Microcontroller (Arduino Uno) â€“ Handles display logic and Bluetooth data parsing.

ðŸ“² Mobile App Features
Built using MIT App Inventor for rapid development and intuitive UI.

Fully customizable interface: users can choose which buttons to show based on the event type (e.g., basketball, volleyball, quiz bee).

Real-time control of scores, timers, and labels directly from the phone.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose
Designed to solve the limitations of traditional scoreboards, this system offers:

Portability â€“ Easy to transport and set up in various venues.

Flexibility â€“ Adaptable to different sports or activities.

Customization â€“ Tailor the app interface to match the needs of any event.

ðŸš€ How It Works
Connect your phone to the scoreboard via Bluetooth.

Launch the custom app and select your event layout.

Use the app buttons to update scores, reset values, or trigger special displays.

The microcontroller receives commands and updates the P10 panels accordingly.
